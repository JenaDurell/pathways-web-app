      correctAnswer: "False",
      info: "Not all debt is the same. For example, $200,000 of credit card debt from maxing out credit cards will hurt your credit score substantially more than $200,000 of mortgage (home loan) debt. "

      quiz: "Checking your report will hurt your score. ",
      answers: [
        "True", "False"
      ],
      correctAnswer: "False",
      info: "A credit inquiry can only affect your score if it's related to a credit application that you have submitted. If you are applying for a loan or a credit card, your score might fall because that application may suggest that you'll be adding debt. However, when you're checking your own credit, it's considered a \"soft inquiry\" and it does not affect your credit score.",

        "Having too many cards will not hurt your credit score.",
      answers: ["True", "False"],
      correctAnswer: "True",
      info: "When you have more cards, you have more credit available. As long as you're paying off your card in full every month and not maxing out your card, then having multiple credit cards won't hurt your score. \n \n However, too many applications in a short period of time can signify financial problems."

        "Carrying a balance on your credit card will boost your credit score.",
      answers: ["True", "False"],
      correctAnswer: "False",
      info: "Carrying a balance on your credit card does not help your credit score. In fact, it can hurt your credit score if it leads to a high credit utilization rate and if you are not paying your bill each month. If you are not paying off your bill, you will have to pay more in the future due to interest. This can quickly become very expensive."

      quiz: "My income and job do not affect my credit score.",
      answers: [
        "True", "False"
      ],
      correctAnswer:
      "True",
      info: "Income is not on your credit report so it can not impact your score. Your employment situation can affect your score indirectly, in terms of your ability to pay off your debts. When you apply for credit, some lenders may ask about your income, but it does not affect your credit score."

      quiz: "Using debit cards helps build a good credit score. ",
      answers: [
       "True", "False"
      ],
      correctAnswer: "False",
      info: "Debit and credit cards are completely separate. Since debit cards are not a form of credit, they are not on your credit report and cannot affect your credit score."

      quiz: "A good credit score means you're rich.",
      answers: [
        "True", "False"
      ],
      correctAnswer:
      "False",
      info: "A good credit score means that you are likely to pay off any credit or loan. This is based on your past behavior, not income. However, if two people with the same credit score applied for the same credit card, the person with the higher income may receive a higher credit limit on their card."

       "True", "False"
      ],
      correctAnswer: "False",
      info: "The length of your credit history is a huge part of your credit score so the sooner you establish credit, the better. However, think about yourself and ensure that you are ready to take on the responsibility of credit and paying it off on time."
